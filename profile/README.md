### About

Interactive Echoes is an organization dedicated to developing audio tools and modular solutions. Our craft bridges the realms of consumer-facing software, as well as versatile libraries and frameworks that empower developers to forge their own creations.

Our focus is on delivering high-quality, modular code that can be seamlessly integrated for a wide range of software projects.

All good software should tell a story and our tales are written in the language of C++.
