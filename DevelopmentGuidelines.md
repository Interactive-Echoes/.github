## License Compliance
All projects use the GPL-2.0-only license, ensuring openness and compliance with its terms. GPL-2.0-only license.

### License Notice and Author Attribution

Each file in the codebase must include a license notice at the top to ensure compliance with legal and organizational standards. The license notice should contain the SPDX identifier and the copyright information in the following format:
